# BCOM-Informatics-Visual-Programming-1
Visual Programming semester subject programs I wrote.

Assignment 1
 - Question 1: Write a program that has two variables named length and breadth. Assign integer values to these variables. Use the formula  area=length * breath to calculate the area of the rectangle.  Display the area using a print command.
 - Question 2: Write a program that has two variables named length and breadth. Assign floating point values to these variables. Use the formula area=length * breath to calculate the area of the rectangle.  Display the area using a print command.  The area must be formatted for two decimal points.
 - Question 3: Write a program that has two variables named myname and mysurname. Assign string values to these variables. Display the string “I am “ with your name and surname in a print command. 
 - Question 4: Write a program that has two variables named nApples and nKids. Assign integer values to these variables.  Divide the number of apples by the number of kids.  Display the result using a print command in the following format:
There are …. kids and … apples. 
Each kid gets …. apples, and …. apples remain.

Assignment 2
 - Question 1: Write a Python program that uses an IF statement.  The program must prompt the user to enter the year of his/her birth as a single integer number.  If the value entered is less than 2000 then the message “welcome from the previous century” is displayed, else the message ‘WELCOME’ is displayed.  The program must display the input value, as well as result of the decision.
 - Question 2: Write a Python program that uses a FOR loop.  The program must prompt the user to enter five integer numbers.  The program must display each of the input values, as well as the sum of all values and the average value.
 - Question 3: Write a Python program that uses a WHILE loop.  The program must prompt the user to enter an integer number.  The value must be added to a total.  The loop must continue until the total exceeds 45.  After the loop, the average of the numbers must be calculated.  The program must display each of the input values, as well as the sum of all values and the average value.
*** enhancement, replace the user prompt with a random number selector.
 - Question 4: Write a Python program that uses string methods and functions.  The program must prompt the user to enter a sentence.  The program must display the input value, as well as the length, maximum, minimum, title and capitalize results.  An explanation message should also be included.  E.g. The length of the string is 7 characters.
